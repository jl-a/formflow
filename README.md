# Form Flow

A form plugin for WordPress.

To run the development environment or build the plugin for deployment you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Quick commands

First install the packages with `npm install`.

**Set up a development environment** with Composer packages installed and a WordPress server that loads the plugin:

```
npm run setup
```

**Start up the development environment** including a WordPress site with the plugin and file watching for frontend building:

```
npm start
```

(The development server is available at [localhost:80](http://localhost). To log into the WordPress admin, use the username `dev` and the password `dev`).
